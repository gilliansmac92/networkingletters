## Historical Introduction

The seventeenth century in the British Isles--specifically the late seventeenth century--could only be described as chaotic. People witnessed and lived through the accession of a Scottish king, a series of civil wars, the attempt to create a British republic, the restoration of absolutist monarchy, and less that three decades later in 1688 the monarchy came crashing down again to close out the seventeenth century with the ascendancy of representative parliament. Jenny Wormwald described the events of the seventeenth century as traumatic, disturbing, and oftentimes violent.<sup>1</sup>
