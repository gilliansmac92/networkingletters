# Networking the Revolution (1688-92)

This is the repository for the collection of data related to letters during the Scottish Revolution 1688-1692. The project wil primarily be use for a study of relationships during revolution and chaos--it will also map out where went and came from. This repository allows further access to critical information about seventeenth century British history and this pivotal period which shaped much of the modern British state. The project is open-access and the data can be reused. 

## Background

During the late seventeenth century, the evolution of newsletters and newspapers allowed information to travel more quickly along those networks. _Networking the Revolution_ seeks to add to this conversation in terms of communication during conflict and regime change. The project uses corpuses of letters including: the Leven and Melville Papers, Hamilton Manuscripts, Jacobite Letters, and eventually will also contain letters from military commanders, the plantation committee, and the privy council. _Networking_ seeks to visualize and connect the world of letters, communication, and networks from disparate collections of manuscript and print sources to understand communication patterns and the distribution of information during wartime. 

By using network analysis, we can uncover the world of the information trade, diplomatic correspondence patterns, and the anomalies. It also helps in prosopographical analysis of the time period, why certain people group together, and understand the dynamics of group identities. Letters are important for more than just their contents. They also have the power to tell us more than just who was writing to who. More importantly, they can tell us who was connected with who, how often letters went missing, the frequency of communication between parties, where networks existed over time and space, and how these evolved over the course of wartime. Through the wireframing of network analysis, this project hopes to reveal the complex world of communication in late seventeenth century Scotland. The letters exchanged in this period are more than just networks of correspondence; people were bound together through community, print, and dialogue.
