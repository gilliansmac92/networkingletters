                <p>The seventeenth century in the British Isles--specifically the late seventeenth century--could only be described as chaotic. People witnessed and lived through the accession of a Scottish king, a series of civil wars, the attempt to create a British republic, the restoration of absolutist monarchy, and less that three decades later in 1688 the monarchy came crashing down again to close out the seventeenth century with the ascendancy of representative parliament. Jenny Wormwald described the events of the seventeenth century as traumatic, disturbing, and oftentimes violent.<sup>1</sup> What the events were not was boring. On November 5, 1688, William of Orange landed on the shores of Torbay, England with 15,000 men. William’s arrival met with mixed responses. Desertions from James’ standing army, including some of his most trusted generals—John Churchill—to William’s cause prompted the late king’s flight to France. Between November 1688 and 1691, the administrative government of the British archipelago underwent a dramatic transformation during the Revolution (1688-90). While the Williamite triumph is well known today, at the time it did not look so certain. Doubt about the viability of the newly instated regime circulated among Jacobite sympathizers. The exact numbers of who supported the deposed king and who did not remain a hotly contested subject in the historiography. . Although James was never able to fulfill his promises to lead the Jacobite cause in Scotland, Ireland hosted the most violent confrontations from the sieges in Derry to the Battle of the Boyne. Louis XIV’s enthusiasm and considerable contributions to the war effort only solidified the growing realization that Ireland and the seas surrounding the British Isles could make or break the Revolution. </p>
                <p>The <i>Leven and Melville Papers</i> capture the difficulties in the reconstruction and administration of Scottish governance. One of the fundamental questions facing the new administration was: should the government include or exclude those with an unpredictable past or suspect loyalty? The corpus contains roughly 600 letters addressed chiefly to Melville, who was the centerpiece of William's regime in Scotland as the Secrtary of State.</p>
